# Machine-Learning

A (WIP) list of Machine Learning algorithms in Python + tutorials with Keras. Currently includes the following:

### Keras

* k-Fold Validation ([Blog Post](https://antmarakis.github.io/keras-k-fold/))

### Classifiers

* k-Nearest Neighbors ([Blog Post](https://antmarakis.github.io/k-nearest-neighbors/))
 
* Perceptron ([Theory](https://antmarakis.github.io/perceptron-theory/), [Implementation](https://antmarakis.github.io/perceptron-implementation/))
 
* Least Squares
 
  * Requires numpy
  
  * Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib

* Naive Bayes Classifier ([Categorical](https://antmarakis.github.io/naive-bayes-cat-intro/), [Numerical](https://antmarakis.github.io/naive-bayes-num-intro/))
  
  * Includes Categorical and Numerical classifiers

* Neural Network ([Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/antmarakis/another-neural-network-from-scratch))
 
  * Requires numpy
  
  * Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib

### Clustering

* kMeans ([Standard](https://antmarakis.github.io/kMeans/))
  
  * Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
  
  * Includes both the online (or sequential) kMeans and the standard (or iterative) algorithm.

### Pattern Recognition

* Viterbi Algorithm (for Hidden Markov Models)

* Edit Distance Algorithm
